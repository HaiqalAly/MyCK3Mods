![Paradox Mod](https://img.shields.io/badge/Paradox%20Game-CK3%20Mod-0059b3?logo=paradoxinteractive&logoColor=white)


## ℹ️ Description
A small collection of my personal Crusader Kings III mods, currently featuring custom traditions, men-at-arms, and tenets. These mods aren’t meant to be fully balanced or serious projects, but I'm planning to expand them over time.

## ✨ Features
- Custom traditions  
- Custom men-at-arms types  
- Custom tenets
- Custom Innovation

## 👥 Culture Affected
- Ainu

## 📥 Installation
### 1. Download & Extract
- Click **Code → Download ZIP**.
- Extract the ZIP.
- Inside, you’ll find:
  - **`halve.mod`**
  - **`halve_flavor`** folder

### 2. Move to CK3 Mod Folder
Place both items into: `Documents/Paradox Interactive/Crusader Kings III/mod/`

📁 mod
 ├─ halve.mod
 └─ 📁 halve_flavor
    └─ 📁 common

### 3. Enable in Launcher
- Open CK3 Launcher → **Mods**
- Add the mod to your **Playset**
- Click **Play**

Done!


Note: Files such as .gitignore, LICENSE, and README.md are development files and should be ignored or safely deleted from the final install location. 

These are development files and **not required** for the mod to work.

## 🔧 Compatibility
- Works with the latest CK3 version  
- Should be compatible with most mods that don’t modify the same traditions/MAA/tenets  

## 📌 Planned Additions
- More traditions  
- More MAA variations  
- Additional tenets  
- New Cultural fascination (Innovations) and more

## 📝 Notes
These mods are made for personal use and may not be balanced.  
Feel free to use or modify them however you like.
